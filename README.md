# Landing Page Catwalk Couture Project 


## About the project 
This project is a landing page for a fashion company known as CatWalk Couture. 
*Catwalk Couture is a fake company that I made up for the sole purpose of this project

This project has HTML and CSS to style the website. It also has some JavaScript to make the website dynamic and interactive. 

## These are some of the features that this project has:

* It has a navigation bar that lets the user dynamically navigate to different sections on the page by clickiing the nav buttions

* It has a section that displays an about me section, a section for their work/what the company does, a portfolio section, and a section for a user to sign up to their newsletter 

* The project also contains some icons and a few links to social media pages (they link to my social media pages but essentially it would be for the company's pages if the company were real), and a "back to top" button that when clicked, brings the user back to the top of the page. The back to the top button only appears once the user has scrolled farther down on the page, and when it appears, it is a button with a paw pointing upwards.
